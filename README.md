### Strengths:
1. **Problem Statement**: The introduction highlights the problem effectively by addressing both the increase in mental health challenges and the stigma around seeking help.
2. **Core Features**: The inclusion of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and a journal entry feature provides a strong foundation for your application.
3. **Technical Simplicity**: Choosing linear regression as the prediction model makes the project approachable for beginners while still demonstrating functionality.
4. **Technical Stack**: Mentioning React Native, Flask, Docker, and the Cohere API adds clarity on your tech choices.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Clarity in Language**: Fix minor grammatical errors and refine the flow to make it easier to read. For example:

   - Explain how recommendations (e.g., YouTube videos, breathing techniques) are tailored based on the scores.

4. **Include Metrics**: If applicable, mention how you evaluate the accuracy of your linear regression model and whether it's performing well for the predictions.

5. **Docker**: Provide a brief explanation of why Docker is beneficial here. For instance: "We used Docker to ensure a consistent environment, reducing dependency-related errors during deployment."

# Soulscan: A Beginner-Friendly Mental Health Application  

In today's fast-paced world, the rise of social media and hectic lifestyles has contributed to an increase in mental health challenges. Despite this, stigma around seeking professional help often prevents individuals from accessing the support they need. **Soulscan** bridges this gap by offering a simple and beginner-friendly mental health application designed to provide users with insights and resources for emotional well-being.  

## Key Features:
1. **Mental Health Questionnaires**:  
   Soulscan incorporates two standardized tools—PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) and GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  
   - **PHQ-9**: 9 questions, scored out of 27.  
   - **GAD-7**: 7 questions, scored out of 21.  
   Each question is scored on a scale from 0 to 3:  
   - 0: Not at all  
   - 3: Almost every day  

   ### Classification of Scores:  
   - **Minimal Severity**: Scores < 5  
   - **Mild**: Scores between 5 and 9  
   - **Moderate**: Scores between 10 and 14  
   - **Severe**: Scores ≥ 15  

   Based on these scores, Soulscan provides personalized recommendations, such as guided meditation videos, breathing exercises, and nearby doctor information.  

2. **Journal Entry & Sentiment Analysis**:  
   Users can record their emotions through a journal feature. Text entries are analyzed using Python's Pandas library and the Cohere API to perform sentiment analysis, offering insights into their emotional well-being.  

3. **Recommendations**:  
   Tailored suggestions, including YouTube videos, breathing techniques, and local professional help, are provided based on users' questionnaire scores and journal sentiment.  

## Technical Details:
- **Front-end**: React Native ensures a seamless, cross-platform user experience.  
- **Back-end**: Flask powers the application's server-side operations.  
- **Prediction Model**: Linear regression is used for simplicity and ease of implementation.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Cohere API and TextBlob analyze journal entries for emotional tone.  
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to ensure consistent development and deployment environments, reducing dependency-related issues.  

## Future Scope:
- Expanding the recommendation engine with more personalized resources.  
- Adding a chatbot for immediate emotional support.  
- Gamifying mental health tracking to boost engagement.

Soulscan aims to make mental health care accessible, stigma-free, and easy to navigate for everyone.
